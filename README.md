# Scripts

Collection of scripts for different purposes, mainly for Capture The Flags, Penetration Testing, and Security Assessments.

* [parse-LaTeX/](parse-LaTeX/): collection of python scripts to parse and clean LaTeX code;
* [pwn-script.py](pwn-script.py): python script that uses pwntools library to exploit simple stack buffer overflows on local or remote targets;
* [gen-payload.sh](gen-payload.sh): bash script usable to generate custom payload to exploit simple stack buffer overflows;
* [ipsweep.sh](ipsweep.sh): bash script that implements a basic IPv4 sweep scan;
* [portscanner.py](portscanner.py): python script that implements a basic single-thread IPv4 port scanner;

Please note that these scripts are just helpers I use in my activities and might be (partially) useful for conscious users. I do not consider them a final product ready out-of-the-box, thus, errors and bugs might be present.

Proposed updates/fixes/improvements are always welcome.
